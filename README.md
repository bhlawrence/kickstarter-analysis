# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
This analysis serves to illustrate the determine of kickstarter campaigns within the 'Theater' category based on what time of year those campaigns were launched. Secondarily, for kickstarter campaigns concerning plays, research was done on how the fundraising goal of each campaign affected its likelihood to succeed. Definitive data on these topics has been created and illustrated with charts. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Time of the year does not seem to contribute to a higher number of canceled kickstarter campaigns in the Theater category. There are a relatively equal number of campaigns canceled throughout the year, regardless of month. 

When it comes to the sucess or failure of kickstarter campaigns in the Theater category, however, you will immediately notice a sharp spike in successes during the summer months. This could mean that there are simply more campaigns launched in the summer months, but the failed and canceled lines are almost unaffected, which means that the summer months are in-fact better for launching a kickstarter campaign in the Theater category. 

This uptick in successes is repeated in February and October, but is also accompanied by a rise in failures, which would suggest that the likelihood of success is not greater. Rather, there are more campaigns being launch at these times of year, so we see a rise in both successes and failures. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Right from the start, the data represented in this chart requires a disclaimer. For campaigns with a fundraising goal greater than $20,000, we have very little data. The sample size for this upper echelon of kickstarter campaigns being so small means that the data can be highly unreliable, and shouldn't be trusted blindly. It is very unlikely that $35,000 is the magic number for kickstarter campaigns in the 'Plays' subcategory. Those 4 successful plays could've received a weird boost in publicity or been  very highly anticipated, throwing off the numbers. 

The lower half of this chart should give some idea for trends, though. Generally speaking, we can see that the lower a fundraising goal for a campaign is, the more likely it is to succeed. We notice a very strong downward trend in successful campaigns as fundraising goal moves up each group. This trend continues out to around $25000, which is likely to be reliable as we still have a decent number of campaigns in those groups from which to draw data. Everything after that becomes sporadic and without trend, however. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Conclusion 1 - Summer is the best time to launch a kickstarter campaign in this category. 

Conclusion 2 - October sees the highest portion of failures, and is likely to be one of the worst months to launch a campaign.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The lower your campaigns fundraising goal is, the more likely you are to hit that goal. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

There is very little data on campaigns with high fundraising goals, meaning data pulled from those higher-goal groups is not reliable or indicative of a larger trend. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could expand the charts we've already created to include a wider group, or even all kickstarter campaigns. Expanding out to include other Categories and Sub Categories would likely help to alleviate the sparse data we had for campaigns with high fundraising goals.
